## Welcome to Sistema de Contactos, a Thymeleaf web app! ðŸš€

Sistema de Empleados is a simple management system where you can add, modify or delete contacts that are allocated in a SQL database. This app is a sort of iteration of a previous JSP app called Sistema de Empleados that you can find [here](https://github.com/ori0nis/sistema-empleados-jsp). The goal was to use a new and similar technology to increase my knowledge/resources in web programming.

The frontend uses Thymeleaf to produce dynamic code, and it was styled using Bootstrap. The database is managed with Springboot, JPA and Hibernate.

This app was created following Ubaldo Acosta's lead during his "Universidad Java" masterclass.
